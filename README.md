# This is the ZMK config repository to go with the Allium58CAD.  

It includes a few customizations such as custom art on the left Nice!View display. 

See my Allium58CAD repository readme for details on the physical build. 

Most of the custom art is original work from Michal Turner out of his Witchblade and Fathom comics. 
There is also some work out of Frank Millers SinCity. All images have been heavily modified to work as black and white bitmaps.
